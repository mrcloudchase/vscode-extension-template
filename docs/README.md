# VSCode WebView Extension Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the VSCode WebView Extension - a sophisticated document processing and technical writing workflow system.

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This documentation provides detailed insights into the architecture, data flow, and implementation details of the extension.

### Available Documentation

| Document | Description | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [**Architecture**](./architecture.md) | Complete system architecture with component relationships | Understanding the overall system design |
| [**Data Flow**](./dataflow.md) | Detailed data flow from input to output with processing stages | Understanding how data moves through the system |

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with focused services
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Deterministic multi-step document creation
- **Template-Based Prompts**: Externalized, reusable prompt templates
- **Type-Safe Processing**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout
- **Lazy Loading**: Performance-optimized service instantiation

## 🔄 Key Data Flow Features

- **Multi-Format Input**: Support for Word, PDF, PowerPoint, text files, URLs, and GitHub PRs
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic input type detection and service routing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time workflow progress updates
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of processing failures
- **Content Aggregation**: Seamless combination of multiple input sources

## 🚀 Quick Start

To understand the system:

1. **Read the [Architecture](./architecture.md)** to understand the component structure
2. **Review the [Data Flow](./dataflow.md)** to see how inputs are processed
3. **Examine the source code** with these diagrams as your guide
