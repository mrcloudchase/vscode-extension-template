# Enhanced Orchestration Prompts

## üéØ **Prompt Enhancements Complete**

All orchestration prompts now include comprehensive data type definitions and realistic examples to guide Copilot toward producing perfect JSON responses.

## üìã **What Was Added to Each Prompt**

### **1. Data Type Definitions**
Each prompt now includes a clear schema definition section:

```json
{
  "fieldName": "type - Description of what this field contains",
  "arrayField": ["type - Description of array elements"],
  "objectField": {
    "nestedField": "type - Description of nested field"
  }
}
```

### **2. Realistic Examples**
Full working examples that demonstrate:
- Complete JSON structures
- Realistic data values
- Professional reasoning and explanations
- Proper array structures
- Comprehensive metadata

## üîç **Enhanced Prompts Overview**

### **01-directory-selection.md**

- **Example**: Shows realistic directory analysis for authentication docs
- **Includes**: Multiple alternative options with detailed reasoning

### **02-content-strategy.md**
- **Data Types**: CREATE vs UPDATE decision fields
- **Examples**: Both CREATE and UPDATE scenarios
- **Includes**: Content overlap analysis and user journey context

## üé® **Key Benefits**

### **1. Clear Expectations**
- Copilot knows exactly what fields to include
- Type information prevents format errors
- Examples show the level of detail expected

### **2. Consistent Output**
- All prompts follow the same structure
- JSON responses will be predictable
- Field names and types are standardized

### **3. Professional Quality**
- Examples demonstrate professional technical writing
- Realistic scenarios show proper decision-making
- Comprehensive coverage of all required fields

### **4. Error Reduction**
- Clear type definitions prevent type mismatches
- Examples show proper JSON formatting
- Field descriptions eliminate ambiguity

## üìä **Example Comparison**

### **Before Enhancement:**
```
You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "selectedDirectory": "exact/path/to/directory",
  "reasoning": "Clear explanation...",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### **After Enhancement:**
```
### Data Type Definitions:
{
  "selectedDirectory": "string - Exact path to the chosen directory",
  "reasoning": "string - Detailed explanation of the selection decision",
  "confidence": "number - Confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0",
  "existingFiles": ["string array - List of existing markdown files"],
  "directoryPurpose": "string - Description of directory use",
  "alternativeOptions": [...]
}

### Example Output:
{
  "selectedDirectory": "docs/guides",
  "reasoning": "The 'docs/guides' directory is the established location for user-facing documentation in this repository. It already contains 12 guide documents following a consistent naming pattern...",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "existingFiles": ["getting-started.md", "security-overview.md"],
  "directoryPurpose": "User-facing guides and tutorials for developers",
  "alternativeOptions": [...]
}
```

- Complete structures with all required fields

### **2. Professional Reasoning**
- Detailed explanations following the examples
- Comprehensive analysis like the realistic examples
- Proper technical documentation language

### **3. Consistent Quality**
- Same level of detail across all steps
- Professional decision-making patterns
- Thorough consideration of alternatives

### **4. Reduced Errors**
